# openownership-scripts

Scripts to convert Malaysian data into Beneficial Ownership Data Standard.

## Terminology

In this repository, the "Beneficial Ownership Data Standard" will be
referenced as "BODS" in README files and scripts.

## Data Standard

The standard has been published. See [latest documentation][1].

The schema is subject to changes before a version 1.0 release. See [latest data schema][2].

A public validator is in beta. See [BODS Data Review Tool][3].

## Attention

The script was originally written based on BODS 0.1 draft. Due to [changes made][4] from BODS 0.1 release, whatever written before that is deprecated and now deemed invalid. As such, the converted data will fail the validation as expected. Project owner and contributors should be informed of this matter.
